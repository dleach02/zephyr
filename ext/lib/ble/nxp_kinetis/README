KW41Z Zephyr Native BLE Support
#####################

Native BLE support in Zephyr on the NXP KW41Z SOC requires linking
with the NXP provided BLE Link Layer Controller library. For reasons,
the libary will need to be manually copied from the KW41Z SDK to this
directory:

<zephyr base>/ext/lib/ble/nxp_kinetis

Obtaining the KW41Z SDK requires setting up an account on nxp.com and
downloading the MCUXpresso SDK for the KW41Z:

https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/en/welcome

After signing in, follow the instructions to build and download the
'FRDM-KW41Z.zip' SDK file. Copy the following library file from the zip
file into the directory referenced above:

<FRDM-KW41Z.zip>\middleware\wireless\bluetooth_1.2.6\controller\lib\lib_ble_kw41z_controller.a


N.B.: NXP is working on a git based deployment of this library that will
more seamlessly integrate into the Zephyr build system.
